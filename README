### Sentiment analysis

Feature Extraction:

Create a boolean vector (size vocabulary) of words appearing in the Tweet.
=> [1,1,0,1,0,0,...]


Create a dictionary of word frequency in positive and negative class.
=> { (word,class): frequency, }


Create the following feature set for a Tweet:
=> [1, sum(positive), sum(negative)]

~~~

Preprocessing:

Stemming and lowercasing: tun -> {tune, tuned, tuning}
Stop words: punctuation or words that are not important (and, are, a, etc.)

# Reinforcement learning
## Fundamentals of reinforcement learning

k-armed bandit:

- Option to choose between k actions.
- Each action yields some unknown reward.


## Exploration-exploitation dilemma

Epsilon-greedy action selection:
- Where epsilon is the probability of choosing to explore.

Optimistic Initial Values:
- Encourages early exploration.

Upper-Confidence Bound (UCB) Action Selection:
- Uses optimism in the face of uncertainty. (using confidence intervals)
- Uses uncertainty in the value estimates for balancing exploration and
  exploitation.

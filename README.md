Deep learning from scratch.

In this repository, I aim to re-implement notebooks from the deep learning
specialization. While the specialization takes a bottom-up approach, it is
still very easy to go through the programming assignments without an
in-depth understanding of the code.

The primary purpose of this repository is to understand and experiment with
deep learning algorithms from the ground-up, and to eventually move beyond
the specialization and learn state-of-the-art algorithms and models.

I will be following a first-principles approach, and will only be using
machine learning libraries when I have a good understanding of their
underlying mechanisms.

Another purpose is to learn the infrastructure and engineering side of deep
learning. So instead of using a cloud notebook platform, I will be doing
complete environment setups on my local cpu, or a cloud gpu when required.
Eventually, I would also like to build end-to-end deep learning products.

Deep learning from scratch.

In this repository, I aim to re-implement notebooks from the deep learning
specialization. The specialization's programming assignments only ask us
for cursory details, and so we miss a lot of learning that we might have
had if we were to write something on our own from scratch.

The primary purpose of this repository is to understand and experiment with
deep learning algorithms from the ground-up, and to eventually move beyond
the specialization and learn state-of-the-art algorithms and models. I will
be following a first-principles approach, and will only be using machine
learning libraries when I have a good understanding of their underlying
mechanisms.

Another purpose of this repository is to learn the infrastructure and
engineering side of deep learning. So instead of using a cloud notebook
platform, I will be doing complete environment setups on my local cpu, or a
cloud gpu when required. Eventually, I would also like to build end-to-end
deep learning products.

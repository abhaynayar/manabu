Deep learning from scratch.

In this repository, I aim to re-implement notebooks from the deep learning
specialization. The specialization's programming assignments only test us
on a few cursory points, and so we miss out on learning a lot of the finer
details.

The primary purpose of this repository is to understand and experiment with
deep learning algorithms from the ground-up, and to eventually move beyond
the specialization and learn state-of-the-art algorithms and architectures.

Another purpose of this repository is to learn the infrastructure and
engineering side of deep learning in order to be a step closer to building
end-to-end deep learning products. So for this repository, I will not be
using any cloud notebook platforms, and instead work on my own environment
setup.
